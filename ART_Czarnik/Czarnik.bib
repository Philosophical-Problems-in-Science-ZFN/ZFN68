In this population, the predictive validity of the mathematical part of the SAT, SAT-M, for academic and vocational criteria has been demonstrated over 10-year gaps. Here, we document aspects of the psychological and achievement profiles of these highly able students, paying particular attention to sex differences. Males score higher on SAT-M (i.e., mathematical reasoning ability) than females; this difference is accompanied by differences between the sexes in spatial-mechanical reasoning abilities and in a number of lifestyle and vocational preferences. Collectively, these attributes appear to play a key role in structuring male-female disparities in pursuing advanced educational credentials and careers in the physical sciences. After profiling a number of the behavioural characteristics of the highly able, we examine some underlying biological correlates of these phenotypic manifestations. These include hormonal influences, medical and bodily conditions and enhanced right hemispheric activation.},

	abstract = {Only for ergodic processes will inferences based on group-level data generalize to individual experience or behavior. Because human social and psychological processes typically have an individually variable and time-varying nature, they are unlikely to be ergodic. In this paper, six studies with a repeated-measure design were used for symmetric comparisons of interindividual and intraindividual variation. Our results delineate the potential scope and impact of nonergodic data in human subjects research. Analyses across six samples (with 87–94 participants and an equal number of assessments per participant) showed some degree of agreement in central tendency estimates (mean) between groups and individuals across constructs and data collection paradigms. However, the variance around the expected value was two to four times larger within individuals than within groups. This suggests that literatures in social and medical sciences may overestimate the accuracy of aggregated statistical estimates. This observation could have serious consequences for how we understand the consistency between group and individual correlations, and the generalizability of conclusions between domains. Researchers should explicitly test for equivalence of processes at the individual and group level across the social and medical sciences.},

	abstract = {The primary objective of the current chapter is to provide an overview of how contemporary research in social psychology, cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuroscience can inform understanding of critical components of the person perception process. In this respect, our treatment of person perception will be unashamedly literal; we will focus on persons and perception. In so doing, we hope our approach will not further muddy already murky waters. As Gilbert (1998) observed in this very chapter in a previous edition of the Handbook, "Social psychologists have studied person perception for more than half a century, and for more than half a century have bemoaned the deficiencies of the phrase." The problem can be summarized as follows. Although the object of inquiry is unquestionable (i.e., people), the processes through which knowledge about the object can be acquired (i.e., perception) has seemed less relevant, at least to social psychologists. As a result, the term person perception has often been applied to refer to how the hidden goals, beliefs, and intentions that guide human behavior are identified, but rarely to elucidate the operations that enable people to recognize inverted faces in poorly illuminated restaurants. Accordingly, an extensive social-psychological literature now charts how people identity and decode the myriad factors (e.g., dispositions, intentions, beliefs) that shape social interaction (Gilbert, 1998). For the most part, however, this work considers the perception of personality, not the perception of people. Given that even highly sophisticated judgments or attributions about others are fueled by inputs that derive from the workings of early perceptual operations, our goal in this chapter is to consider the perceptual processes through which person understanding emerges. Hence we attempt to elucidate how perceptual operations contribute toward the abstraction of both variant (e.g., emotional expression, gaze direction) and invariant (e.g., sex, identity) aspects of person knowledge from available physical cues (Bruce \& Young, 1986; Burton, Brace, \& Johnston, 1990; Haxby et al., 2000, 2002). In this respect, following a description of the different classes of person knowledge that can be extracted from facial and bodily cues, we switch attention to a consideration of the basic processing operations and associated neural structures that support person perception. In so doing, our objective is to furnish an integrative account of contemporary research exploring the dynamics of person construal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

It does so by making such representations appear fixed and unchanging as well as in stark contrast to the identities of those who engage in and perpetuate them. Stereotypes diminish the social standing of those targeted, reducing them to a particular attribute or disposition that either demeans them or confines them to achievement only in association with this attribute or disposition. This acts as a distancing mechanism, radically separating those stereotyped from those among whom the stereotypes circulate and are reproduced. Stereotyping always occurs within a two-way, but one-sided relationship and operates in favor of the existing status quo.},

	abstract = {"This book employs a careful, rigorous, yet lively approach to the timely question of whether we can justly generalize about members of a group on the basis of statistical tendencies of that group. For instance, should a military academy exclude women because, on average, women are more sensitive to hazing than men? Should airlines force all pilots to retire at age sixty, even though most pilots at that age have excellent vision? Can all pit bulls be banned because of the aggressive characteristics of the breed? And, most controversially, should government and law enforcement use racial and ethnic profiling as a tool to fight crime and terrorism? Frederick Schauer strives to analyze and resolve these prickly questions. When the law "thinks like an actuary"--Makes decisions about groups based on averages--the public benefit can be enormous. On the other hand, profiling and stereotyping may lead to injustice. And many stereotypes are self-fulfilling, while others are simply spurious. How, then, can we decide which stereotypes are accurate, which are distortions, which can be applied fairly, and which will result in unfair stigmatization? These decisions must rely not only on statistical and empirical accuracy, but also on morality. Even statistically sound generalizations may sometimes have to yield to the demands of justice. But broad judgments are not always or even usually immoral, and we should not always dismiss them because of an instinctive aversion to stereotypes. As Schauer argues, there is good profiling and bad profiling. If we can effectively determine which is which, we stand to gain, not lose, a measure of justice."--Publisher's description},

It is an expectation that people might have about every person of a particular group. The type of expectation can vary; it can be, for example, an expectation about the group's personality, preferences, or ability.
Stereotypes are generalized because one assumes that the stereotype is true for each individual person in the category. While such generalizations may be useful when making quick decisions, they may be erroneous when applied to particular individuals. Stereotypes lead to social categorisation, which is one of the reasons for prejudice attitudes, and may arise for a number of reasons.},
