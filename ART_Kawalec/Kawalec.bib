	abstract = {Of the three main areas of science studies that emerged after WWII (Kawalec, 2018), namely social studies of science, economics of knowledge and scientometrics, it was the latter that gained particular prominence in science policy around the 1990’s with the advent of New Public Management (Pollitt, Thiel, \& Homburg, 2007). One of its focal areas has been identification of emerging topics in science. They are incessantly assumed to be an outcome of a simple cumulative progress of scientific knowledge (Price, 1976; Merton, 1988; Bird, 2007; Fochler, 2016). In my paper I challenge this assumption of simple cumulativity and argue that the emergence of breakthrough topics in science is preceded by a sequence of transformation phases. Using the example of “microRNA\&cancer” as an emergent topic identified by a quantitative analysis of a large dataset of publications (Small et al. 2014) I demonstrate that the proposed analysis of transformation phases complements big data quantitative analyses with theoretical understanding of the dynamics mechanism and, in effect, leads to a more adequate characterization of the topic itself as well as a more precise identification of the source publications. While the proposed method uses a more complex (meso-level) unit of analysis (i.e. “research routines”) instead of citations and co-occurrence of single publications (micro-level), it integrates quantitative with qualitative analyses.},

In C. elegans, mature lin-4 miRNA accumulates at the end of the first larval stage to repress its direct targets lin-14 and lin-28, allowing the progression of several somatic cell types to later larval fates. In this study, we characterized the expression of endogenous lin-4 and found that temporally regulated independent transcripts, but not constitutive lin-4 containing RNAs derived from an overlapping gene, are processed to mature lin-4 miRNA. Through an RNAi screen, we identified a conserved RNA binding protein gene rbm-28 (R05H10.2), homologous to the human RBM28 and yeast Nop4p proteins, that is important for lin-4 expression in C. elegans. We also demonstrate that rbm-28 genetically interacts with the lin-4 developmental timing pathway and uncover a previously unrecognized role for lin-14 and lin-28 in coordinating organismal growth.},

The available methods to regulate this family of miRNAs have so far been mostly genetic and therefore not easily performed experimentally. Here, we describe a small molecule screen designed to identify regulators of let-7 targets in human cells. In particular, we focused our efforts on the identification of small molecules that could suppress let-7 targets, as these could serve to potentially intercede in tumors driven by loss of let-7 activity. After screening through roughly 36,000 compounds, we identified a class of phosphodiesterase inhibitors that suppress let-7 targets. These compounds stimulate cAMP levels and raise mature let-7 levels to suppress let-7 target genes in multiple cancer cell lines such as HMGA2 and MYC. As a result, these compounds also show growth inhibitory activity on cancer cells.},

In the past 20 or so years there has been a considerable growth in teaching and research programmes dealing with science and technology policy, science and society, sociology and history of science and similar areas which has resulted in much new material about the production and validation of scientific knowledge. In addition to the quanti­ tative growth of this literature, there has also been a substantial shift in the problems addressed and approaches adopted. In particular, the substantive content of scientific knowledge has become the focus of many historical and sociological studies which seek to understand how knowledges develop and change in different social circumstances. Instead of taking the privileged epistemological status of scientific knowledge for granted, recent approaches have emphasised the socially contingent nature of knowledge production and validation and the pluralistic nature of the sciences. Parallel to these develop­ ments, there has been a shift in the treatment of science by the state, business and public pressure groups. Increasingly they have sought to control the direction of research, and thus the content of knowledge, directly rather than simply applying existing knowledge. Science has become amenable to social control and influence. Its sacred status has declined and it is increasingly viewed as a socially constituted phenomenon which can be studied in a similar manner to other cultural products.},

Circulating miRNAs have been repeatedly and stably detected in blood and hold promise to serve as molecular markers for diverse physiological and pathological conditions. To date, the relationship between circulating miRNAs and active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) has not been reported. Using microarray-based expression profiling followed by real-time quantitative PCR validation, the levels of circulating miRNAs were compared between patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis and matched healthy controls. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic effect of selected miRNA. Bioinformatic analysis was used to explore the potential roles of these circulating miRNAs in active pulmonary tuberculosis infection. Among 92 miRNAs significantly detected, 59 miRNAs were downregulated and 33 miRNAs were upregulated in the TB serum compared to their levels in the control serum. Interestingly, only two differentially expressed miRNAs were increased not only in the serum but also in the sputum of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis compared to the levels for the healthy controls. Upregulated miR-29a could discriminate TB patients from healthy controls with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. A number of significantly enriched pathways regulated by these circulating miRNAs were predicted, and most of them were involved in acute-phase response, inflammatory response, and the regulation of the cytoskeleton. In all, for the first time our results revealed that a number of miRNAs were differentially expressed during active pulmonary tuberculosis infection, and circulating miR-29a has great potential to serve as a marker for the detection of active pulmonary tuberculosis infection.},

While miRNAs mean to contribute the developments of normal functions, abnormal expression of miRNAs and regulations on their corresponding targets have often been found in the developments of AML and described in recent years. In leukemia, miRNAs may function as regulatory molecules, acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Overexpression of miRNAs can down-regulate tumor suppressors or other genes involved in cell differentiation, thereby contributing to AML formation. Similarly, miRNAs can down-regulate different proteins with oncogenic activity as tumor suppressors.

Here, we show that let-7 is highly expressed in normal lung tissue, and that inhibiting let-7 function leads to increased cell division in A549 lung cancer cells. Overexpression of let-7 in cancer cell lines alters cell cycle progression and reduces cell division, providing evidence that let-7 functions as a tumor suppressor in lung cells. let-7 was previously shown to regulate the expression of the RAS lung cancer oncogenes, and our work now shows that multiple genes involved in cell cycle and cell division functions are also directly or indirectly repressed by let-7.

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to the cellular transcript leading to translational repression or degradation of the target mRNA. Dicer and Drosha are the miRNA processing enzymes that are required for the maturation of miRNAs. Here, we investigated the role of Dicer and Drosha for angiogenesis. Endothelial cells were transfected with siRNA against Dicer and Drosha to inhibit miRNA biogenesis. Genetic silencing of Dicer and Drosha significantly reduced capillary sprouting of endothelial cells and tube forming activity. Migration of endothelial cells was significantly decreased in Dicer siRNA–transfected cells, whereas Drosha siRNA had no effect. Silencing of Dicer but not of Drosha reduced angiogenesis in vivo. Next, we attempted to identify miRNAs expressed in endothelial cells. A screening analysis of 168 human miRNAs using real-time PCR revealed that members of the let-7 family, mir-21, mir-126, mir-221, and mir-222 are highly expressed in endothelial cells. Dicer and Drosha siRNA reduced lef-7f and mir-27b expression. Inhibitors against let-7f and mir-27b also reduced sprout formation indicating that let-7f and mir-27b promote angiogenesis by targeting antiangiogenic genes. In silico analysis of predicted targets for let-7 cluster identified the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-1. Indeed, Dicer and Drosha siRNA significantly increased the expression of thrombospondin-1. Taken together, transient reduction of the miRNA-regulating enzyme Dicer impairs angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, whereas Drosha siRNA induced a minor antiangiogenic effect in vitro and was not effective in vivo. The let-7 family and mir-27b appear to be attractive targets for modulating angiogenesis.},

OBJECTIVE: Because many inflammatory pathways are known to be regulated by microRNAs, permitting a rapid and fine-tuned response, the role of microRNA-mediated regulation of IL-13 was investigated using both in vitro and in vivo studies.
METHODS: A combination of in silico approaches and in vitro transfections in A549 cells and primary cultured T cells was used to demonstrate the involvement of let-7 in IL-13 regulation. Furthermore, intranasal delivery of let-7 microRNA mimic in mice was performed to study its effects in allergic airway inflammatory conditions.
RESULTS: Using a combination of bioinformatics and molecular approaches, we demonstrate that the let-7 family of microRNAs regulates IL-13 expression. Induced levels of IL-13 in cultured T cells were inversely related to let-7 levels. In an IL-13-dependent murine model of allergic airway inflammation, we observed that inflammation was associated with a reduction in most of the members of the let-7 family. Exogenous administration of let-7 mimic to lungs of mice with allergic inflammation resulted in a decrease in IL-13 levels, resolution of airway inflammation, reduction in airway hyperresponsiveness, and attenuation of mucus metaplasia and subepithelial fibrosis.
CONCLUSION: Let-7 microRNAs inhibit IL-13 expression and represent a major regulatory mechanism for modulating IL-13 secretion in IL-13-producing cell types and thereby T(H)2 inflammation.},

Almost all identified miRNAs are conserved in the human genome and are also frequently found in nonmammalian vertebrate genomes, such as pufferfish. In heart, liver, or brain, it is found that a single, tissue-specifically expressed miRNA dominates the population of expressed miRNAs and suggests a role for these miRNAs in tissue specification or cell lineage decisions.

We used the C. elegans clone to isolate the gene from three other Caenorhabditis species; all four Caenorhabditis clones functionally rescue the lin-4 null allele of C. elegans. Comparison of the lin-4 genomic sequence from these four species and site-directed mutagenesis of potential open reading frames indicated that lin-4 does not encode a protein. Two small lin-4 transcripts of approximately 22 and 61 nt were identified in C. elegans and found to contain sequences complementary to a repeated sequence element in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of lin-14 mRNA, suggesting that lin-4 regulates lin-14 translation via an antisense RNA-RNA interaction.},

Here, we report that chromosomal translocations previously associated with human tumors disrupt repression of High Mobility Group A2 (Hmga2) by let-7 miRNA. This disrupted repression promotes anchorage-independent growth, a characteristic of oncogenic transformation. Thus, losing miRNA-directed repression of an oncogene provides a mechanism for tumorigenesis, and disrupting a single miRNA-target interaction can produce an observable phenotype in mammalian cells.},

In general, transcription of the let-7 primary transcript (pri-let-7) occurs early in development, whereas processing of the mature let-7 microRNA arises during cellular differentiation. In Caenorhabditiselegans and other animals, the RNA-binding protein LIN-28 post-transcriptionally inhibits let-7 biogenesis at early developmental stages, but the mechanisms by which LIN-28 does this are not fully understood. Nor is it understood how the developmental regulation of let-7 might influence the expression or activities of other microRNAs of the same seed family. Here, we show that pri-let-7 is trans-spliced to the SL1 splice leader downstream of the let-7 precursor stem-loop, which produces a short polyadenylated downstream mRNA, and that this trans-splicing event negatively impacts the biogenesis of mature let-7 microRNA in cis Moreover, this trans-spliced mRNA contains sequences that are complementary to multiple members of the let-7 seed family (let-7fam) and negatively regulates let-7fam function in trans Thus, this study provides evidence for a mechanism by which splicing of a microRNA primary transcript can negatively regulate said microRNA in cis as well as other microRNAs in trans.},

	abstract = {This collection of essays explores the metaphysical thesis that the living world is not ontologically made up of substantial particles or things, as has often been assumed, but is rather constituted by processes. The biological domain is organized as an interdependent hierarchy of processes, which are stabilized and actively maintained at different timescales. Even entities that intuitively appear to be paradigms of things, such as organisms, are actually better understood as processes. Unlike previous attempts to articulate processual views of biology, which have tended to use Alfred North Whitehead’s panpsychist metaphysics as a foundation, this book takes a naturalistic approach to metaphysics. It submits that the main motivations for replacing an ontology of substances with one of processes are to be looked for in the empirical findings of science. Biology provides compelling reasons for thinking that the living realm is fundamentally dynamic and that the existence of things is always conditional on the existence of processes. The phenomenon of life cries out for theories that prioritize processes over things, and it suggests that the central explanandum of biology is not change but rather stability—or, more precisely, stability attained through constant change. This multicontributor volume brings together philosophers of science and metaphysicians interested in exploring the consequences of a processual philosophy of biology. The contributors draw on an extremely wide range of biological case studies and employ a process perspective to cast new light on a number of traditional philosophical problems such as identity, persistence, and individuality.},

Mutations in heterochronic genes cause temporal transformations in cell fates in which stage-specific events are omitted or reiterated2. Here we show that let-7 is a heterochronic switch gene. Loss of let-7 gene activity causes reiteration of larval cell fates during the adult stage, whereas increased let-7 gene dosage causes precocious expression of adult fates during larval stages.  let-7 encodes a temporally regulated 21-nucleotide RNA that is complementary to elements in the 3′ untranslated regions of the heterochronic genes  lin-14, lin-28, lin-41, lin-42 and daf-12, indicating that expression of these genes may be directly controlled by  let-7. A reporter gene bearing the lin-41 3′ untranslated region is temporally regulated in a let-7-dependent manner. A second regulatory RNA, lin-4, negatively regulates lin-14 and lin-28  through RNA–RNA interactions with their 3′ untranslated regions3,4.

	abstract = {This study describes the global mammalian micoRNA response to Salmonella infection and the role of miRNAs in regulating the post-transcriptional control of inflammatory cytokines., MicroRNAs have well-established roles in eukaryotic host responses to viruses and extracellular bacterial pathogens. In contrast, microRNA responses to invasive bacteria have remained unknown. Here, we report cell type-dependent microRNA regulations upon infection of mammalian cells with the enteroinvasive pathogen, Salmonella Typhimurium. Murine macrophages strongly upregulate NF-κB associated microRNAs; strikingly, these regulations which are induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) occur and persist regardless of successful host invasion and/or replication, or whether an inflammatory response is mounted, suggesting that microRNAs belong to the first line of anti-bacterial defence. However, a suppression of the global immune regulator miR-155 in endotoxin-tolerant macrophages revealed that microRNA responses also depend on the status of infected cells. This study identifies the let-7 family as the common denominator of Salmonella-regulated microRNAs in macrophages and epithelial cells, and suggests that repression of let-7 relieves cytokine IL-6 and IL-10 mRNAs from negative post-transcriptional control. Our results establish a paradigm of microRNA-mediated feed-forward activation of inflammatory factors when mammalian cells are targeted by bacterial pathogens.},

	abstract = {lin-4 and let-7 are founding members of an extensive family of genes that produce small transcripts, termed microRNAs (miRNAs). In Caenorhabditis elegans, lin-4 and let-7 control the timing of postembryonic events by translational repression of target genes, permitting progression from early to late developmental programs. To identify Drosophila melanogaster miRNAs that could play similar roles in the control of developmental timing, we characterized the developmental expression profile of 24 miRNAs in Drosophila, and found 7 miRNAs that are either upregulated or downregulated in conjunction with metamorphosis. The upregulation of three of these miRNAs (mir-100, mir-125, and let-7), and the downregulation of a fourth (mir-34) requires the hormone ecdysone (Ecd) and the activity of the Ecd-inducible gene Broad-Complex. Interestingly, mir-125 is a putative homologue of lin-4. mir-100, -125, and let-7 are clustered within an 800-bp region on chromosome 2L, suggesting that these three miRNAs may be coordinately regulated via common cis-acting elements during metamorphosis. In S2 cells, Ecd and the juvenile hormone analog methoprene exert opposite effects on the expression of these four miRNAs, indicating the participation of both these hormones in the temporal regulation of mir-34, -100, -125, and let-7 expression in vivo.},

The naturalistic impulse to describe, interpret, and explain, rather than to evaluate and justify, was not a notable feature of commentary about science before Kuhn’s work, and I trace this new naturalism to historical changes in the institutional and cultural conditions of science itself in post-World War II America. The possibility of naturalism about the nature of science, I argue, flowed partly from its new institutional security and its strengthened ties with political power.},

A. INTRODUCTION
The Cold Spring Harbor Symposium of two years ago dealt with many of the problems being considered at the present one. It is of interest to examine the advances which have been recorded in the intervening two years. The present paper focuses attention on the mechanisms of information transfer involved in the conversion of genotype into phenotype at the level of protein composition.
Evidence was presented in 1961 from a number of laboratories (Brenner, 1961; Gros et al., 1961b; Hurwitz et al., 1961; Jacob and Monod, 1961; Spiegelman, 1961) which led to what many accepted as a satisfactory molecular model of the intracellular flow of genetic information. The essential features are diagrammatically summarized in Fig. 1. Three principal modes of information [Graphics Excised] transfer are recognized and distinguised by the end purposes they serve. The first is a duplication, designed primarily to...},

The mature miRNA-let-7 family was considered as the most important miRNA for the cancer incidence and progression. Recently, the promising let-7 miRNAs were reported to be associated with various cancers, but the results were inconsistent. We performed a first-reported systematic review with a meta-analysis for the association of let-7 family single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with cancer risk/prognosis. Ten studies were included with a total of 3878 cancer cases and 4725 controls for the risk study and 1665 cancer patients for the prognosis study in this meta-analysis. In the risk study, the let-7i rs10877887 and let-7a-1/let-7f-1/let-7d rs13293512 were shown no significant association for the overall cancer risk. In the stratified analysis, the rs10877887 variant genotype was significantly associated with a decreased cancer risk in head and neck cancer (TC compared with TT: P=0.017; odds ratio (OR) = 0.81; TC + CC compared with TT: P=0.020; OR = 0.82). In the prognosis study, the let-7i rs10877887 SNP was shown to be associated with a higher risk for cancer prognosis in the dominate model (P=0.004; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.32). The other two SNPs (let-7a-1 rs10739971 and let-7a-2 rs629367) were not found to be associated with cancer survival. None of the let-7 family polymorphisms had potential to be biomarkers for cancer susceptibility but let-7i rs10877887 SNP had potential to be predicting markers for cancer prognosis. In the future, large-sample studies are still needed to verify our findings.},

Here we demonstrate that a temporal gradient in Lin-14 protein is generated posttranscriptionally by multiple elements in the lin-14 3'UTR that are regulated by the heterochronic gene Lin-4. The lin-14 3'UTR is both necessary and sufficient to confer lin-4-mediated posttranscriptional temporal regulation. The function of the lin-14 3'UTR is conserved between C. elegans and C. briggsae. Among the conserved sequences are seven elements that are each complementary to the lin-4 RNAs. A reporter gene bearing three of these elements shows partial temporal gradient activity. These data suggest a molecular mechanism for Lin-14p temporal gradient formation: the lin-4 RNAs base pair to sites in the lin-14 3'UTR to form multiple RNA duplexes that down-regulate lin-14 translation.},
