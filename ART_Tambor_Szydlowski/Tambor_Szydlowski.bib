	abstract = {I argue that the laws of physics should be independent of one's choice of units or measuring apparatus. This is the case if they are framed in terms of dimensionless numbers such as the fine structure constant, alpha. For example, the Standard Model of particle physics has 19 such dimensionless parameters whose values all observers can agree on, irrespective of what clock, rulers, scales... they use to measure them. Dimensional constants, on the other hand, such as h, c, G, e, k..., are merely human constructs whose number and values differ from one choice of units to the next. In this sense only dimensionless constants are "fundamental". Similarly, the possible time variation of dimensionless fundamental "constants" of nature is operationally well-defined and a legitimate subject of physical enquiry. By contrast, the time variation of dimensional constants such as c or G on which a good many (in my opinion, confusing) papers have been written, is a unit-dependent phenomenon on which different observers might disagree depending on their apparatus. All these confusions disappear if one asks only unit-independent questions. We provide a selection of opposing opinions in the literature and respond accordingly.},

	abstract = {Effective field theories have been a very popular tool in quantum physics for almost two decades. And there are good reasons for this. I will argue that effective field theories share many of the advantages of both fundamental theories and phenomenological models, while avoiding their respective shortcomings. They are, for example, flexible enough to cover a wide range of phenomena, and concrete enough to provide a detailed story of the specific mechanisms at work at a given energy scale. So will all of physics eventually converge on effective field theories? This paper argues that good scientific research can be characterised by a fruitful interaction between fundamental theories, phenomenological models and effective field theories. All of them have their appropriate functions in the research process, and all of them are indispensable. They complement each other and hang together in a coherent way which I shall characterise in some detail. To illustrate all this I will present a case study from nuclear and particle physics. The resulting view about scientific theorising is inherently pluralistic, and has implications for the debates about reductionism and scientific explanation.},

In addition to minor corrections and updates throughout, this new edition contains materials on higher order Melnikov functions and the bifurcation of limit cycles for planar systems of differential equations, including new sections on Francoise's algorithm for higher order Melnikov functions and on the finite codimension bifurcations that occur in the class of bounded quadratic systems.},

	abstract = {We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 ≤ z ≤ 0.62. The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H0), the mass density (ΩM), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, ΩΛ), the deceleration parameter (q0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\%–15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (ΩM = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., ΩΛ {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q0 0 at the 3.0 σ and 4.0 σ confidence levels, for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a "minimal" mass density, ΩM = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, ΩΛ {\textgreater} 0 at the 3.0 σ confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat universe prior (ΩM + ΩΛ = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require ΩΛ {\textgreater} 0 at 7 σ and 9 σ formal statistical significance for the two different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., ΩM = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7 σ to 8 σ confidence level for the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe to be 14.2 ± 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the data with ΩΛ = 0 and q0 ≥ 0.},

The fundamental quest in theoretical cosmology is to identify the origin of this phenomenon. In principle there are two possibilities: (1) the presence of matter which violates the strong energy condition (a substantial form of dark energy) or (2) modified Friedmann equations (Cardassian models—a non-substantial form of dark matter). We classify all these models in terms of two-dimensional dynamical systems of the Newtonian type. We search for generic properties of the models. It is achieved with the help of Peixoto’s theorem for dynamical systems on the Poincaré sphere. We find that the notion of structural stability can be useful to distinguish the generic cases of evolutional paths with acceleration. We find that, while the ΛCDM models and phantom models are typical accelerating models, the cosmological models with bouncing phase are non-generic in the space of all planar dynamical systems. We derive the universal shape of the potential function which gives rise to presently accelerating models. Our results show explicitly the advantages of using the potential function (instead of the equation of state) to probe the origin of the present acceleration. We argue that simplicity and genericity are the best guide in understanding our Universe and its acceleration.},

Then the class of all dark energy models (called a multiverse) can be regarded as a Banach space naturally equipment in the structure of the Sobolev metric. In this paper we explore notion of \$C{\textasciicircum}\{1\}\$ metric introduced in the multiverse which measure distance between any two dark energy models. If we choose cold dark matter as a reference one then we can find how so far apart are different models offering explanation of present accelerating expansion phase of the Universe. We consider both models with dark energy (models with the generalized Chaplygin gas, models with variable coefficient equation of state
\$w\_\{X\}={\textbackslash}frac\{p\_\{X\}\}\{{\textbackslash}rho\_\{X\}\}\$ parameterized by redshift \$z\$, models with phantom matter) as well as models basing on some modification of the Friedmann equation (Cardassian models, Dvali-Gabadadze-Porati brane models).

	abstract = {We measure cosmological parameters using the three-dimensional power spectrum P(k) from over 200 000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in combination with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and other data. Our results are consistent with a “vanilla” flat adiabatic cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant without tilt (ns=1), running tilt, tensor modes, or massive neutrinos. Adding SDSS information more than halves the WMAP-only error bars on some parameters, tightening 1σ constraints on the Hubble parameter from h≈0.74+0.18−0.07 to h≈0.70+0.04−0.03, on the matter density from Ωm≈0.25±0.10 to Ωm≈0.30±0.04 (1σ) and on neutrino masses from {\textless}11 to {\textless}0.6eV (95\%). SDSS helps even more when dropping prior assumptions about curvature, neutrinos, tensor modes and the equation of state. Our results are in substantial agreement with the joint analysis of WMAP and the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, which is an impressive consistency check with independent redshift survey data and analysis techniques. In this paper, we place particular emphasis on clarifying the physical origin of the constraints, i.e., what we do and do not know when using different data sets and prior assumptions. For instance, dropping the assumption that space is perfectly flat, the WMAP-only constraint on the measured age of the Universe tightens from t0≈16.3+2.3−1.8Gyr to t0≈14.1+1.0−0.9Gyr by adding SDSS and SN Ia data. Including tensors, running tilt, neutrino mass and equation of state in the list of free parameters, many constraints are still quite weak, but future cosmological measurements from SDSS and other sources should allow these to be substantially tightened., This article appears in the following collection:},

Science and philosophy have a strong interaction and an unquestionable complementarity but one needs to draw a clear line between what they tell on the world, on their scope and implications.

Role of Cosmology

Cosmology does indeed play an important role in this debate. It has long been part of mythology and philosophy and, during the twentieth century, adopted a scientific method, thanks to the observational possibilities offered by astrophysics. We can safely state that scientific cosmology was born with Einstein's general relativity, a theory of gravitation that made space and time dynamical, a physical field that needs to be determined by solving dynamical equations known as Einstein field equations. The concept of spacetime was born with this theory, and in its early years cosmology was a space of freedom to think general relativity (Eisenstaedt, 1989). It led to the formulation of a ‘standard’ model, often referred to as the big bang model, that allows us to offer a history of the matter in the universe, in particular by providing an explanation for the synthesis of each of the elements of the Mendeleev table, and a history of the formation of the large scale structure. Cosmology has also excluded many possible models and hypotheses, such as the steady state model or topological defects as the seeds of the large scale structure.The current standard cosmological model can be summarised by Figure 6.1 from which one can easily conclude that all the phenomena that can be observed in our local universe, from primordial big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) to today, rely mostly on general relativity, electromagnetism and nuclear physics, that is on physics below 100 MeV and well under control experimentally (see Ellis et al. (2012); Mukhanov (2005); Peter and Uzan (2009) for textbooks on modern cosmology). This is an important property since the fact that we can understand our observable universe does not rely on our ability to construct e.g. a theory of quantum gravity. This is the positive aspect, the negative one being that it may be very difficult to find systems in which gravity, quantum physics and observations appear together, inflationary perturbations and black holes being probably the only ones. At later time, the dynamics of the large scale structure becomes non-linear and requires the use of numerical simulations to be fully understood.},

The ideas of effective theories have been implicit in science for a long time, but have only been articulated well in the last few decades. Since Wilson's renormalization group revolution in the early 1970's, the science community has come to more fully understand its power, and by the mid-1990's it had gained its apotheosis. It is still one of the most powerful concepts in science, which has direct impact in how one thinks about and formulates theories of nature. It is this power that this Brief sets out to emphasize through historical analysis and current examples.},

It is shown that the Widom-Kadanoff scaling laws arise naturally from these differential equations if the coefficients in the equations are analytic at the critical point. A generalization of the Kadanoff scaling picture involving an "irrelevant" variable is considered; in this case the scaling laws result from the renormalization-group equations only if the solution of the equations goes asymptotically to a fixed point.},
